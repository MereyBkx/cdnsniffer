# CDNSniffer Chrome Extension

I'd like to know which of the free, public CDNs are curently most popular
and will most likely be in user's browser caches.

The idea of this extension is to log the CDNs used by the websites you frequently
visit.

Raw data is logged to a Google Spreadsheet and can be seen at
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bSCPV3jOJ7DN-J1U00FquUjZ4b-hVWmta5PFK2U42-g/

I will publish a blog post with the results at some point in the future. 

You can help by installing the extension from the Google Webstore at
